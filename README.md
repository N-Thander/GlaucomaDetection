# AI-Powered Glaucoma Detection Platform 👁️‍🗨️

A cutting-edge platform designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing glaucoma and accessing the latest research in eye care! Leveraging machine learning and large language models, this platform provides a powerful suite of tools for retinal analysis, disease detection, and personalized insights.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

🔬 **EyeVanguard** is a subscription-based platform for hospitals that integrates modern technology to advance the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. The key features include:
1. **📚 Research Hub**: Search and access the latest research papers and discoveries in eye research.
2. **🧑‍⚕️ AI-Powered Doctor's Assistant**: A custom-built LLM-based agent that assists doctors in analyzing complex eye conditions.
3. **🖼️ Glaucoma Detection**: Upload FUNDUS images for precise and quick AI-based analysis of retinal conditions.
4. **⚡ Seamless Integration**: Built with **React.js** for the frontend, **Flask** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** for robust data management.

## 🌟 **Key Features**
- **LLM Doctor Assistant Bot**: Get real-time analysis and recommendations for eye diseases.
- **Fundus Image Analysis**: Upload retina images for deep analysis and detection using advanced AI models.
- **Research Paper Hub**: Stay updated with the latest discoveries in ophthalmology.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js ⚛️
- **Backend**: Flask 🐍
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 🐘
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained AI models for FUNDUS image detection.
